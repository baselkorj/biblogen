# biblogen

A reference manager and biblography generator for your projects and research, built using Flutter and Moor.

# current status

The project is currently on hault with only the GUI and the database functions complete. The 2.0 Flutter update resulted in many issues with the database functions that I don't feel like solving currently. The project might be migrated to Hive in the future instead of Moor.

# to do
- [ ] Configure biblography formatting for different referencing styles.
- [ ] Implement the ability to generate biblography to PDF and DOCX files.
- [ ] Debug on real hardware.
